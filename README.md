## Introduction to My Corpus
  My corpus is Turkish Pop songs based on a playlist created by me by extracting pop songs from Spotify playlists of Turkish 80s, Turkish 90s, Turkish 2000s and Turkish 2010s. I would like to compare 90's Turkish pop songs first to older songs and second to newer songs. I don't want to treat 80s songs and 2000s songs as the same group because they also highly differ. This is an interesting comparison because 90's songs are highly distinguishable by their general sound. A person who is familiar with 90's Turkish pop can easily guess whether a Turkish pop song is from 90's or not. People sometimes say "sounds 90's like" to descibe new music which shows that there is a common charactersitics of this corpus. Another aspect which makes these comparisons interesting is the increasing populairty of the 90's Turkish pop songs. These songs are more popular today than they were 20 years ago, although more recent or older songs do not show the same pattern of popularity. For example 80's songs did not regain their popularity 20 years after their release. I would like to understand what makes 90's songs different. 
  
  I think my corpus is highly representative of the groups that I want to compare in terms of time periods. One limitation of my corpus is that it is based on my personal opinion about what makes a song a pop song since I hand-picked songs from Spotify's period playlists. Altough, I am also highly expereinced in Turkish music and made my decisions based on artits' self identification or general public opinions about genres. 
  
  Pop songs are usually fast in tempo and danceable. Therefore, I think slow tempo songs like "Gitme Kal Bu Şehirde" by Nazan Öncel from 90's or "Mesafe" by Serdar Ortaç from 2000s are atypical tracks. Other than the tempo which makes some of the songs atypical, I don't think there is another feature which makes some of the songs more typical than others. I am not able to distinguish a song for being extremely typical than the others at this stage.
